OpenShift is a platform as a service product from Red Hat.

The software that runs the service is open-sourced under the name **OpenShift Origin**, and is available on GitHub. Developers can use Git to deploy web applications in different languages on the platform. A version for cloud computing is named **OpenShift Enterprise**.

OpenShift also supports binary programs that are web applications, so long as they can run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This allows the use of arbitrary languages and frameworks. OpenShift takes care of maintaining the services underlying the application and scaling the application as needed.

This training walks you through an initial OpenShift installation and helps you build a first Hello World application.

Enjoy!
